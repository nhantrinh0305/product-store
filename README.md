# EZSeller â€“ Product Management App

A full-stack web application that allows users to manage products â€” including adding, editing, deleting, and viewing product details â€” with secure login authentication and theme customization. The backend is built with Express, connected to a NeonDB PostgreSQL database, and protected by ArcJet for bot and rate limiting. The frontend uses React, Zustand for state management, and TailwindCSS (with DaisyUI) for styling. The project is deployed fully on Render.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete products
- Theme switcher (light/dark/forestâ€¦)
- Simple login authentication (hardcoded user)
- Rate limiting & bot protection with ArcJet
- Zustand for global state (products, auth, theme)
- Deployed on Render (backend + frontend)
